            // the way UIKit can. Also, this doesn't seem interruptible, reversible, or smooth AND it uses a LOT of
            // CPU. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I think the answer is that anything that needs focus in tvOS needs to be written in UIKit so
            // it can access the deeper animation controls there. But honestly, for Swatches I don't care enough to
            // do that, it's just a simple development utility.
