import SwiftUI

/// A platform-independent view that supports tvOS's concept of focus. On any platform other than tvOS this just renders the provided content. On tvOS a
/// `focusScale` can be passed to use when the content has focus and the view will animate to/from that scale when it gains/loses focus. If no value is passed
/// in then a default scale of `1.15` will be applied. Note that other platforms will accept a `focusScale`, but do not use it for anything.
/// - Note: iOS does not support the `focusable()` modifier in iOS 13 (contrary to what was demonstrated at WWDC) & we don't need the animation
///     on macOS or watchOS; so the only platform that actually *does* anything in this view is tvOS.
/// - Note: SwiftUI on tvOS is still seems a bit janky. It can't separate the "focus" from the "unfocus" animation the way UIKit can. Also, this doesn't seem
///     interruptible, reversible, or smooth AND it uses a LOT of CPU. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I think the answer is that anything that needs focus in tvOS needs to be written in
///     UIKit so it can access the deeper animation controls there. But honestly, for Swatches I don't care enough to do that, it's just a simple development utility.
///     The ability to scroll through views is all that we need here, and see where the focus is.
