/// as well as a closure that maps a `Model` object into a `CellView`. Given the optimal width of the cell and the available width it determines how many
/// columns to flow the cells into.
/// - Note: The "grid" is a loose one, notably cells can be different heights in a row. Also if the last row doesn't have a full list of cells then those cells will
///     larger and not aligned into the same columns as the bulk of the view.
