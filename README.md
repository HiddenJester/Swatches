# Swatches
Color Swatches from UIKit, SwiftUI, and other system assets

A simple little app to display swatches of various system colors to see how they look under various conditions (dark mode, high contrast, etc.)

**NOTE:** Although I use fastlane to deploy this project to the App Store, the fastlane configuration files require knowing various credentials that should not be exposed here in the public repo. So the fastlane files are in a separate private repo. If you wish to build Swatches to run on device you'll need to update the signing to use your own credentials.
